# The-Maze

Explation: This is a game were the player is a character and you are trying to get through the maze. When going through you cannot touch the walls otherwise you have to restart. Why: I think it will be fun to create and play. Difficulty: I think that this will have a medium difficulty because I need to get all of the lines in the correct spots, and make them all work the same. Program Concepts: I have to understand how to create functions for the characters and walls. Help: I will probably need help with making it so the player restarts when they touch the wall.
